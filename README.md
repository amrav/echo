## Echo
Echo lets you transfer data - like contacts, files and URLs - between phones via sound. Sound has several important advantages over sharing via Bluetooth or the Internet.
- **Offline**: Does not require network access. Useful in planes and villages.
- **Quick**: Does not require any setup. A Bluetooth transfer would require pairing the devices first. Internet messaging applications like WhatsApp would require you to know the other person's phone number / contact details. With Echo, you just have to be in listening distance.
- **One-to-many**: With Echo, you can simultaneously send the same data to all phones in range. Useful when sharing your phone number at your first day at work.

#### Contact Sharing
With Echo, you can share contact details between phones via sound.

Select a contact, and tap 'Share'. You will see Echo in the options. Ask your friend(s) to open Echo. Your phone will emit a 2-second sequence of tones, while your friend's phone listens. That's it, the contact information is transferred!

Tip: If you want to share your own number with a group of people, simply save your number as a contact, ask everyone to open Echo, and broadcast your number to everyone simultaneously.

#### URL Sharing
Echo converts your URL to a goo.gl shortened URL, and then transfers it via sound. The client app picks up the URL and opens the link on your browser.

Note: Echo is currently buggy.
